# Talker Manager

## About
The goal was to develop an API of talkers that presents all the CRUD operations, using middlewares. Since we didn't use a real DB, the read-write actions were made with `fs` module.

## Tools
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Express Rescue
- Body Parser

### Developed Skills
- Create an Express.js application
- Use routes
- Apply middlewares
- Use Node.js native module `fs`
- NPM validators

### In works:
As of now, I am no longer working on this project.
